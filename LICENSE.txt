The MIT License is a permissive free software license originating at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).[5] As a permissive license, it puts only very limited restriction on reuse and has, therefore, an excellent license compatibility.[6][7] The MIT license permits reuse within proprietary software provided that all copies of the licensed software include a copy of the MIT License terms and the copyright notice. The MIT license is also compatible with many copyleft licenses, such as the GNU General Public License (GPL); MIT licensed software can be integrated into GPL software, but not the other way around.[8]

As of 2015, it was the most popular software license on GitHub, ahead of any GPL variant and other free and open-source software (FOSS) licenses.[9] Notable projects that use one of the versions of the MIT License include Ruby on Rails, Node.js, jQuery, and the X Window System.

License terms
A common form of the MIT License is this (taken from the Open Source Initiative's website; this is identical to the "Expat License", and different from the license used in the X source code):[10]

Copyright (c) <year> <copyright holders>

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal
in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights

LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM,
OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE
SOFTWARE.
An intermediate form of license used by the X Consortium for X11 used the following wording:[11]

Copyright (C) <date> X Consortium

Variants
Because MIT has used many licenses for software, the Free Software Foundation considers "MIT License" ambiguous. "MIT License" may refer to the Expat License (used for the XML parsing library Expat)[12] or to the X11 License (also called "MIT/X Consortium License"; used for the X Window System by the MIT X Consortium).[13] The "MIT License" published by the Open Source Initiative[10] is the same as the "Expat License".

The X11 License[13] and the "MIT License" chosen for ncurses by the Free Software Foundation[14] both include the following clause, absent in the Expat License:[12]

Except as contained in this notice, the name(s) of the above copyright holders shall not be used in advertising or otherwise to promote the sale, use or other dealings in this Software without prior written authorization.

Comparison to other licenses
The original BSD license also includes a clause requiring all advertising of the software to display a notice crediting its authors. This "advertising clause" (since disavowed by UC Berkeley[15]) is present in the modified MIT License used by XFree86.

The University of Illinois/NCSA Open Source License combines text from both the MIT and BSD licenses; the license grant and disclaimer are taken from the MIT License.

The ISC license contains similarities to both the MIT and simplified BSD licenses, the biggest difference being that language deemed unnecessary by the Berne Convention is omitted.[16][17]

Relation to Patents
Like the BSD license the MIT license does not include an express patent license. Both the BSD and the MIT licenses were drafted before the patentability of software was generally recognized under US law.[18] A similarly permissive license, which includes an explicit contributor's patent license, is the Apache License version 2.0+.[2] The MIT license contains terms that are used in defining the rights of a patent holder in 35 U.S Code section 154 namely "use", and "sell". This has been construed by some commentators as an implicit license to use any underlying patents.[19]

Reception
As of 2015, according to Black Duck Software[20][better source needed] and a 2015 blog[9] from GitHub, the MIT license was the most popular free software license, with the GNU GPLv2 coming second in their sample of repositories. In June 2016 an analysis of the Fedora Project's packages revealed the MIT as most used license.[21][not in citation given]

Notable projects that use one of the versions of the MIT License include Expat, an XML parser library; Ruby on Rails, a web application framework; Node.js, a web application runtime environment; jQuery, a JavaScript library; the Lua programming language; and the X Window System, for which the license was originally written. Microsoft's .NET Core framework is also published under MIT License and the source code repository on GitHub includes the license for anyone visiting the resource.

Permissive licensing simplifies things One reason the business world, and more and more developers [...], favor permissive licenses is in the simplicity of reuse. The license usually only pertains to the source code that is licensed and makes no attempt to infer any conditions upon any other component, and because of this there is no need to define what constitutes a derived work. I have also never seen a license compatibility chart for permissive licenses; it seems that they are all compatible.

Archived from the original on 2015-06-17. Retrieved 2015-05-30. The licences for distributing free or open source software (FOSS) are divided in two families: permissive and copyleft. Permissive licences (BSD, MIT, X11, Apache, Zope) are generally compatible and interoperable with most other licences, tolerating to merge, combine or improve the covered code and to re-distribute it under many licences (including non-free or 'proprietary').
